# movie-rec

I am creating this webpage as a practice project to get fimilar using the javascript fetch method.

Currently, the webpage uses the OMDB API to fetch movies when searching for a movie title. However, in the future I want to use other APIs to generate a list of recommended movies based on the film searched and show what streaming services the movies can be viewed on.

The webpage is in the "Neobrutalism" style. I like the style, but may change it in the future.
